# Info
vicmil-pip is a package manager for installing things, much like pip in python
(but with other things such as utility files and other things that may not be related to python)

# Getting started
python vicmil-pip.py help 
    or
python3 vicmil-pip.py help 

# Documentation
https://vicmil.uk/packages



# More details
When you install something, a map called vicmil/ will be created, where all packages
    you install will be stored. Nothing external will be installed on your computer.

The idea is for all the packages to be cross-platform(windows, linux, mac), so the thing
    you actually install may vary depending on platform. The idea is for all packages to
    use a permissive licence, so they can be used in commercial applications. Read more
    about specific packages at: https://vicmil.uk/packages

You can also opt-out of using vicmil-lib but still use the packages by navigating to
    https://vicmil.uk/packages, there you will find install instructions for installing
    the packages manually and read more about where they came from.

This is the main file, and the only thing you need to use vicmil-pip
